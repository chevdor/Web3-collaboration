# Milestone Delivery Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit a milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestones by email to grants@web3.foundation.

The submission should contain the following information: 
 * **Name of the grant project**
 * **Link to the open-source code/delivery** (including the correct open-source license)
 * **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)** 
 * **A list of the [milestone deliveries](#milestone-deliveries)**
 * **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## Testing Guide

Please provide documentation on how to install and/or test the delivery. Ideally, this is done in the form of a publicly available readme file or something similiar, so that others can potentially leverage the project and learn from it. 

## Milestone Deliveries

Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself.

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | ... |...| ...| 
| 2.  | ... |...| ...| 

## Additional Information

Please add any additional comments that you consider relevant for the evaluation.
